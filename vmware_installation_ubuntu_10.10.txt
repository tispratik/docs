The VM communication interface socket family is used in conjunction with the VM
communication interface to provide a new communication path among guests and 
host.  The rest of this software provided by VMware Server is designed to work 
independently of this feature.  If you wish to have the VSOCK feature  you can 
install the driver by running vmware-config.pl again after making sure that 
gcc, binutils, make and the kernel sources for your running kernel are 
installed on your machine. These packages are available on your distribution's 
installation CD.

Configuring a host-only network for vmnet1.

Please specify a name for this network. 
[HostOnly] 

Do you want this program to probe for an unused private subnet? (yes/no/help) 
[yes] help

Virtual machines configured to use host-only networking are placed on a virtual
network that is confined to this host.  Virtual machines on this network can 
communicate with each other and the host, but no one else.

To setup this host-only networking you need to select a network number that is 
normally unreachable from the host.  We can automatically select this number 
for you, or you can specify a network number that you want.

The automatic selection process works by testing a series of Class C subnet 
numbers to see if they are reachable from the host.  The first one that is 
unreachable is used.  The subnet numbers are chosen from the private network 
numbers specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1918 
(http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1918.txt).

Remember that the host-only network that virtual machines reside on will not be
accessible outside the host machine.  This means that it is OK to use the same 
number on different systems so long as you do not enable communication between 
these networks.

Do you want this program to probe for an unused private subnet? (yes/no/help) 
[yes] 

Probing for an unused private subnet (this can take some time)...
